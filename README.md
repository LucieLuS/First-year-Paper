Title: When will Leaders of Developing Countries Negotiate South-North Preferential Trade Agreements?

Data sources, research designs and codes for first-year paper project

My first-year paper is interested in the political motivations of leaders in developing countries to negotiate a particular type of international treaty with developed countries, the South-North preferential trade agreement. When are they more likely to do so? I hope this study can shed some new lights on exploring how leaders can use trade agreement as a political instrument to consolidate their power at home. 


Highlights of this project:
New measures for leaders' secureness; 
Innovative research design to capture secureness shock (hypothesized treatment);
