# Title: When will Leaders of Developing Countries Negotiate South-North Preferential Trade Agreements?

My first-year paper is interested in the political motivations of leaders in developing countries to negotiate a particular type of international treaty with developed countries, the South-North preferential trade agreement. When are they more likely to do so? I hope this study can shed some new lights on exploring how leaders can use trade agreement as a political instrument to consolidate their power at home. 


# Highlights of this project:  
1. New measures for leaders' secureness; 
2. Innovative research design to capture secureness shock (hypothesized treatment);
